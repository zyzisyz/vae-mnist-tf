VAE and Triplet Loss tf experiments report.

1. VAE

VAE is a generative-model, which is a popular approach to unsupervised learning of complicated distributions. 
It can not only reproduce input, but also reduce noise. 

Datasets: mnist
Code: 
    1) https://github.com/zyzisyz/vae-mnist-tf
    2) https://github.com/zyzisyz/tensorflow-mnist-VAE
    3) https://github.com/hwalsuklee/tensorflow-mnist-VAE

Visualizations of learned data manifold for generative models with 2-dim.

2. Triplet Loss

Triplet Loss is a way to learn good embedding. 
In the embedding space, voice from the same speaker should be cloase together and form well separated clusters.

Datasets: mnist
Code:
    1) https://github.com/zyzisyz/tensorflow-triplet-loss
    2) a tf official triplet loss API: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/losses/metric_learning/triplet_semihard_loss
